# Probabilistic Treshold-free Cluster Enhancement 

Welcome to the wiki pages of pTFCE!

pTFCE (probabilistic TFCE) is a cluster-enahncement method to improve detectability of neuroimaging signal.
It performs topology-based belief boosting by integrating cluster information into voxel-wise statistical inference.

The following pages provide and overview of the theoretical basis, and a some examples for the usage of the pTFCE technique.

For a detailed description and theory, please refer to (and please cite):
